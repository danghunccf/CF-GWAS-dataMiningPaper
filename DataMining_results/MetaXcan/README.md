These are data mining results of the Cystic Fibrosis Gene Modifier GWAS data using MetaXcan tools (https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan), and GWAS summary statistics. This is an alternative approach to PrediXcan starting from summary GWAS statistics, which was performed for comparison, but ultimately did not make into our paper.

Association test results to CF lung function, KNoRMA, using gene expression predictive models from cis-SNPs derived from individual human tissues are contained in the archive, metax_allTissue_allfix.tar.gz.

The resultant p-values, beta coefs and z-scores from all tissues (48 GTEx, 2 CF, and DGN), or 48 GTEx tissues were combined with corresponding gene annotation info. Meta-analysis of dependent multiple tissue p-values were performed using the Harmonic Mean Pvalue method, and used to compare with results obtained from PrediXcan and TWAS/FUSION.

Overall conclusion:
The different approaches (PrediXcan, MetaXcan, TWAS/FUSION) yielded similar, but non-identical results.
