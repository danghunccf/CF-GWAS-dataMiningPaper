These are GWAS summary statistics testing variance associations to the quantitative Cystic Fibrosis lung disease severity phenotype (KNoRMA) from the whole CF patient cohorts, as reported by Corvol, et al, Nat Commun. 2015 Sep 29;6:8382. doi: 10.1038/ncomms9382.
The GWAS imputation used were updated compared to originally reported by Corvol, et al, and was described in detail by Panjwani, et al, NPJ Genom Med. 2018 Mar 20;3:8. doi: 10.1038/s41525-018-0047-6.
The results were split into individual chromosomes, and the format is similar to previously reported (Corvol, et al).
