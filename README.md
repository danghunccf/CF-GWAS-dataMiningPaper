# CF-GWAS-dataMiningPaper
These are support files for our manuscript on data mining of the Cystic Fibrosis GWAS studies, using reference eQTL data sets.
These files are organized into folders:

  * GWAS_results: updated GWAS_results from latest GWAS imputation, following the same protocol as Covol et al.
  * CF_PredictDB_models: These are predictive models of gene expression from cis-SNPs within 1 Mbase of genes using eQTL training data from CF patient cohorts, following the PrediXcan GTEx_v7_PredicDB pipeline.
  * DataMining_results: These are CF lung function, KNoRMA, association testing results from imputed gene expression by cis-SNPs via the predictive models.
  * Data_for_figures: These are data tables used to generate the figures in our paper, where relevant.
